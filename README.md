#cryptorankr

I created a #cryptocurrency tracker web app that I've branded as "cryptorankr"! It uses CoinGecko's Crypto API to retrieve realtime data such as rankings, live prices, trading volume, market cap, and market cap change percentages! It also lists the top 7 trending cryptocurrencies as searched by #coingecko users in last 24 hours.

The application is made entirely using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery.

For the animations, I used GreenSock's animation library with their ScrollTo and ScrollTrigger plugins.
